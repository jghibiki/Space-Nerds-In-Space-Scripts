# Space Nerds In Space Scripts

A few scripts I am working on for space nerds in space

## Waves
Fight multiple waves of enemy ships who are determined to destroy your home planet. Difficulty increases with each wave.

## Auto Campeign (WIP)
Automatically generate a campeign from 14 randomly chosen universe designs, and several scenarios that are randomly pieced togeather to make an epic campeign with no need for a DM.

### Progress
- Galaxy Designs
    - [x] Galaxy Design 0
        - split: split universe into 3rds with the middle third a no-man's land (aka two factions)
    - [X] Galaxy Design 1
        - quartered: split universe into 8ths with 4 clusters separated by no-man's land
    - [ ] Galaxy Design 2
        - dense center: densely packed center surrounded by empty space
    - [ ] Galaxy Design 3
        - bulls eye: dense exterior ring surrounding a cluster in the center
    - [ ] Galaxy Design 4
        - doughnut: one dense ring
    - [ ] Galaxy Design 5
        - 2 arm spiral: two dense arms spiraling around the center of the universe
    - [ ] Galaxy Design 6
        - 3 arm spiral: three dense arms spiraling around the center of the universe
    - [ ] Galaxy Design 7
        - 4 arm spiral: four dense arms spiraling around the center of the universe
    - [ ] Galaxy Design 8
        - fill: evenly spread distribution
    - [ ] Galaxy Design 9
        - many random dense: many randomly placed dense clusters
    - [ ] Galaxy Design 10
        - few random dense: few randomly placed dense clusters
    - [ ] Galaxy Design 11
        - many random sparse: many randomly placed sparse clusters
    - [ ] Galaxy Design 12
        - few random sparse: few randomly placed sparse clusters
    - [ ] Galaxy Design 13
        - unknown: random distribution in unknown space and sparse distrobution in known space
- Scenario Designs
    - [ ] Determine how to make scenarios interchangable, rearrangable, and have a cohesive story
        - Maybe try something like betrayal at house on the hill. Location and items you have determine what scenario you get next.
